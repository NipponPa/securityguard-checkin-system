Security Guard Check-In System

A simple, locally hosted web application that lets security guards check in by scanning QR codes placed at different checkpoints (rooms, gates, parking lot, cafeteria, etc.). The system automatically records the time, date, and location of each check-in, making attendance and patrol tracking more reliable.
